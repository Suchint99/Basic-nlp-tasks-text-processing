Project Descriptions
Tweet Sentiment Analysis (NLP_tweet.ipynb)
This project analyzes the sentiment of tweets using NLP techniques. It involves preprocessing the tweet text, vectorizing the data, and applying machine learning models to classify sentiments.

Spam Detection (spam_dataset_nagendra.ipynb)
This notebook builds a spam detection model using SMS message data. It includes text preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF, and training classifiers like Naive Bayes to identify spam messages.
